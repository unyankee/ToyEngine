Tiny project started to test some vulkan features.


The end goal is to build a GPU-driven framegraph using Vulkan that I could use to experiment on new features (such as mesh shaders, workgraphs etc...) or techniques that I am interested.


Since I mostly have worked on GPGPU during my career, and I want to explore more areas, the idea is to start investigating all the techniques from the groud up that I could not do on my job. Those are mainly lighting-related, 
for all of those that I have read, but not implemented yet. 
That said, I want to add as well most of the things that I have worked along this time, and making heavy use of compute shaders, since I still see many games not taking full potential of what can be achieved using them.
